# Alphabet-Classification-using-MLP-Backpropagation-
A Multi-Layer Perceptron is implemented to classify Handwritten Alphabet images using the Backpropagation algorithm which coded from scratch, without using any framework.


 
## Dataset 
- The [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mohneesh7/english-alphabets/data#) is an Image-Dataset obtained from Kaggle under the header 'English Alphabets' which is available under the CCO License.
- The dataset contains 26 folders - with each folder having the name as the alphabet itself (in uppercase). Each of these folders contain 34 x 34 images of the respective alphabets



## Framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)


## Installation
- git clone https://github.com/Rohanmestri/Alphabet-Classification-using-MLP-Backpropagation.git

## How to use?
- Copy the src/main.py to the folder where the dataset is downloaded amongst the folders of the letter A,B,C..
- Execute the following line:
       python main.py [filename]
- [filename] is the name of the directory where the dataset and the code is present.
- The code is written to classify 5 letters A,B,C,D,E and appropriate changes can be made to incorporate more letters.
